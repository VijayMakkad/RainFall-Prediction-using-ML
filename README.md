# Rainfall Prediction Repository

Welcome to the Rainfall Prediction Repository! In this repository, you will find an IPython Notebook file (`rainfall_prediction.ipynb`) and a CSV file (`weatherAUS.csv`) containing weather data for rainfall prediction.

## Files:

1. `rainfall_prediction.ipynb`: This IPython Notebook file contains the code for predicting rainfall based on the weather details provided in the `weatherAUS.csv` file. You can open and run this notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

2. `weatherAUS.csv`: This CSV file contains the weather details required for rainfall prediction. It includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. These features will be used in the rainfall prediction model implemented in the `rainfall_prediction.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage:

To use the rainfall prediction model:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `rainfall_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the `weatherAUS.csv` file and train the rainfall prediction model.
4. Analyze the results and predictions made by the model.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)

Make sure you have all the necessary packages installed before running the notebook.

## Notes:

- This rainfall prediction model is based on machine learning techniques and may not be perfectly accurate. Use it for educational and experimental purposes.
- Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different algorithms and features to improve the prediction accuracy.
